## Current State

### Completed
- ✅ 5 pages built and functional: Home, Sheets, Playlists, Writing, Pictures
- ✅ Dark theme implemented (#131313 background)
- ✅ Light theme implemented (#f5f5f5 background) with toggle
- ✅ Theme persistence via localStorage

- GSAP (spatial page only)
- No frameworks, no build tools
- Files organized: css/, js/, pictures/, fonts/ directories

### Design System Formalized
- Colors: #131313 (bg), rgb(28,28,28) (button bg), #c8c8c8 (text), #ffffff (active)
- Spacing: 5px, 8px, 10px, 15px, 20px, 25px, 30px, 40px, 50px, 60px, 70px, 80px
- Border radius: 5px, 10px, 20px, 25px, 50%
- Animations: 0.2s (fast), 0.3s (elements), 0.4s (floating), 0.5s (pages), 0.7s (spotlight)
- Components: Buttons, floating buttons, social icons, big dropdowns, small dropdowns, back button, theme toggle

### Documentation Created
- ✅ CLAUDE.md - Development guidelines and project rules
- ✅ DESIGN_SYSTEM.md - Complete design token reference
- ✅ TECH_STACK.md - Technical constraints and capabilities
- ✅ APP_FLOW.md - User journey documentation
- ✅ PRD.md - Product requirements document

## Recently Completed (This Session)
- Created comprehensive documentation suite
- Fixed spatial homepage button visibility issues
- Fixed GSAP console warnings (missing .name-container element)
- Updated button positioning in spatial.css

## In Progress
- Documentation complete, ready for design audit phase

## Planned Next
- Conduct full design audit using DESIGN.md guidelines
- Implement Phase 1 design improvements
- Consider making index-spatial.html the main homepage
- Add Pictures page link to home navigation (or keep hidden intentionally)
- Review and improve accessibility

## Known Issues

### Functional Issues
- [ ] Pictures page back button uses direct href instead of JavaScript animation
- [ ] Pictures page images have generic alt text ("Description of photo X")
- [ ] Playlists page has one link with leading space in href (POND link)

### Animation/Performance
- [x] Console warnings fixed in spatial.js (name-container guards added)
- [ ] GSAP warnings may appear briefly in console history (cached from before fix)

### Accessibility Issues
- [ ] Social icons missing aria-labels
- [ ] Back buttons missing aria-labels (only have Font Awesome icons)
- [ ] Dropdown buttons missing aria-expanded attribute
- [ ] No skip-to-content link
- [ ] Focus states rely on browser defaults (could be more visible)

### Responsive Issues
- [ ] Spatial page buttons may drift off-screen on very narrow viewports during GSAP animation
- [ ] No explicit tablet breakpoint (jumps from mobile to desktop)

## Design Debt

### Spacing Inconsistencies
- [ ] Pictures page back-button uses margin-top (50px) instead of fixed position like other pages
- [ ] Sheets page links use margin-bottom: 20px, could use consistent spacing token
- [ ] Content container margin-top calculations vary across pages (8vh + 60px, 8vh + 70px)

### Typography
- [ ] Font Awesome icons vs. SVG icons inconsistency (back button vs. theme toggle)
- [ ] Sheets links use 35px, playlists use 24px/20px - could be more systematic

### Component Consistency
- [ ] Pictures page back button implementation differs from other pages
- [ ] Playlists gradient overlay is unique to that page - could be systematic

### Color Usage
- [ ] rgb(28, 28, 28) and #1c1c1c are the same but written differently across files
- [ ] Light mode overrides scattered across multiple CSS files (could consolidate)

## Technical Debt

### Code Organization
- [ ] Duplicate social icon styles in home.css and spatial.css
- [ ] Light mode CSS scattered across multiple files
- [ ] No CSS custom properties (would enable easier theming)

### HTML
- [ ] Missing meta description on all pages
- [ ] Missing Open Graph tags for social sharing
- [ ] Missing favicon link in <head> (file exists but not linked)

### JavaScript
- [ ] script.js handles multiple concerns (navigation, dropdowns, theme) - could modularize
- [ ] No error handling for missing elements

## Notes
- Main branch: main
- Current worktree: eloquent-merkle
- Animations are critical to UX - must maintain smoothness at 60fps
- Vanilla JS constraint is intentional - no frameworks
- Dark theme is the primary experience, light mode is secondary
- Pictures page is intentionally hidden (no link from home)
- Spatial homepage is experimental - may become main homepage

## Session History
- Feb 5, 2025: Created documentation suite (DESIGN_SYSTEM.md, TECH_STACK.md, APP_FLOW.md, PRD.md, progress.txt), fixed spatial page issues
